# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree
# Project 1: Navigation

## Project Overview

For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

* 0 - move forward.
* 1 - move backward.
* 2 - turn left.
* 3 - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.


## Getting started

This repo is ready to work on macos, download everything and install dependencies with:

pip install requirements.txt

Then just run the notebook *Navigation.ipynb*
* If you want to see how the agent trains, execute the whole notebook.
* The project already contains the weights for a trained agent, so if you just want to see how it works, execute the first cell (importing requirements) and the cell in section 4.
